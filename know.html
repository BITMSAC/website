              With the pandemic taking a toll on the lives of everyone, students
              were in a tight spot. Quite obviously, insecurities about the
              future started creeping in. Hence the Sports Mentorship and
              Adventure Club, SMAC BIT Mesra decided to conduct a Mentorship
              Drive Program wherein students can get the answers of the
              questions that they are stuck in. Captain Dharamveer Singh gave an
              insight into the army life and how students can apply for it and
              make a good career. Also, our very own seniors were a part of the
              program and they untangled the mess and motivated us to use this
              lockdown to prepare ourselves for the better. It was truly an
              inspiring program that was conducted amidst the lockdown.

              transcendent quality, the disallowed goals and the shock incidents
              that we reminiscence. What Happened Next was an exhilarating event
              filled with passion for all such football enthusiasts who live for
              the moments. The event consisted of two rounds. Both the rounds

              questions—textual, image based and video based. All the
              participants were divided into group of 5 for Round-1 and the best
              performers amongst them qualified for Round-2. These teams then
              faced off against each other in Round-2 to decide the winner.
